# UI Redesign Report

## Overview

Complete redesign of the Chronam VS Code extension from a single-purpose wave viewer into a full-featured FPGA IDE sidebar panel, following the product vision in `prompt.md`.

---

## Screens Redesigned

- **Wave Viewer sidebar** → **Chronam IDE Panel** — replaced the single-function wave viewer with a full activity bar section containing 11 dockable panels
- **Activity Bar** — added a dedicated Chronam icon in the VS Code activity bar (mirroring Explorer, Source Control, Extensions, etc.)
- **Dashboard** — new project overview with build status, simulation state, timing summary, and quick-action buttons
- **Explorer** — file browser for project VHDL/testbench/constraint files
- **Build** — build controls (Build, Rebuild, Stop, Clear) with live output log and error/warning counters
- **Simulation** — simulation controls (Run, Pause, Resume, Restart, Step, Stop) with timing info and log
- **Waveforms** — existing waveform viewer wrapped as a panel within the Chronam IDE
- **Timing** — timing summary with clock domain table, slack, violations
- **Constraints** — timing constraint viewer with add-constraint support
- **Hardware** — device info, resource usage (LUTs, FFs, BRAM, DSP)
- **AI Assistant** — chat interface with suggestion chips for VHDL assistance
- **Reports** — report list (compilation, simulation, timing, coverage, performance)
- **Settings** — simulator config, waveform viewer settings, general preferences

```

### Extension Side (`apps/vscode-extension`)

- **`providers/waveViewSidebar.ts`** — updated HTML title/error message; serves the new Chronam panel
- **`commands/index.ts`** — added 3 new commands: `chronam.openDashboard`, `chronam.openBuildPanel`, `chronam.openSimulationPanel`
- **`package.json`** — added `viewsContainers` section with `chronam-activity` activity bar entry; moved views into `chronam-activity` container; registered new commands

## UI Components Created

| Component | Lines | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SidebarNav` | 96 | 48px vertical icon bar with 11 navigation items and active indicator |
| `DashboardPanel` | 163 | Project info, build/simulation/timing status, action buttons |
| `ExplorerPanel` | 96 | File explorer with type badges and hover states |
| `BuildPanel` | 130 | Build toolbar, error/warning counters, terminal output |
| `SimulationPanel` | 140 | Simulation controls grid, info panel, log output |
| `WaveformsPanel` | 57 | Wrapper for existing Toolbar + WaveCanvas |
| `TimingPanel` | 119 | Timing summary rows, clock domain table |
| `ConstraintsPanel` | 88 | Constraint list with type badges |
| `HardwarePanel` | 89 | Device/resource info display |
| `AiAssistantPanel` | 136 | Chat interface with suggestion chips |
| `ReportsPanel` | 88 | Report list with status badges |
| `SettingsPanel` | 165 | Settings form with selects, inputs, toggles |
| `useChronamStore` | 83 | Zustand store for all panel state |

## Design Principles Applied

- **No rounded cards** — all panels use flat, sharp-cornered design
- **Minimal padding** — 8-12px padding throughout
- **Monospace typography** — `Cascadia Code`, `JetBrains Mono`, `IBM Plex Mono` throughout all panels
- **VS Code native integration** — all colors use `var(--vscode-*)` CSS variables for seamless theme support
- **Compact density** — 4-6px vertical spacing, 36px nav items, 12px base font
- **Status badges** — colored uppercase labels for build/simulation/report status
- **Hover feedback** — subtle background changes on interactive elements

---

## Existing Code Preserved

- `WaveCanvas.tsx` — unchanged (294 lines)
- `Toolbar.tsx` — unchanged (79 lines)
- `useWaveStore.ts` — unchanged (100 lines)
- `vscode.ts` — unchanged (31 lines)
- `main.tsx` — unchanged (10 lines)
- `SimulationService` — unchanged (322 lines)
- `WaveViewerPanel` — unchanged (157 lines, editor tab still works)

---

## CLI Improvements

No CLI improvements in this phase. The CLI remains part of a future phase.

---

## Waveform Renderer Improvements

No waveform renderer changes in this phase. The canvas renderer remains as-is.

---

## Performance Optimizations

- Virtual scrolling inherited from existing `WaveCanvas`
- Zustand stores use selective subscription to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- All styles are inline objects (no CSS-in-JS runtime)

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Existing:
- `F6` — Run Simulation (VHDL editor focus)

New (via commands):
- `chronam.openDashboard`
- `chronam.openBuildPanel`
- `chronam.openSimulationPanel`

These are programmatic commands that can be bound in VS Code keyboard shortcuts.

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Waveform Renderer Redesign** — oscilloscope aesthetic: almost-black background, dark green grid, neon green traces, glowing lines, perfect anti-aliasing (per prompt.md)
2. **Professional CLI** — `chronam` command with beautiful output, progress bars, shell completion (per prompt.md)
3. **Panel state persistence** — save active panel, panel sizes between sessions
4. **Live waveform updates** — real-time simulation streaming to waveform panel
5. **Interactive simulation** — pause/resume/step actually wired to backend
6. **Tree-sitter VHDL parser** — replace regex parser with tree-sitter-vhdl
7. **Multi-file project support** — proper project file management
8. **AI assistant integration** — connect to LLM for VHDL assistance
9. **Signal search/filter** — search signals across all hierarchies
10. **Radix switching** — Hex/Dec/Bin per-signal display
11. **Timing analysis integration** — real timing data from synthesis tools
12. **Device programming** — FPGA bitstream loading

## Remaining Polish Opportunities

- Add transition animations to panel switching
- Implement panel header collapse/expand
- Add drag-to-reorder for signal list
- Implement right-click context menus in panels
- Add empty-state illustrations for panels with no data
- Improve loading states with skeleton screens
- Add tooltip descriptions to all icon buttons
- Implement keyboard navigation between panels (Ctrl+Tab)
- Add panel search functionality
- Implement panel state persistence across VS Code sessions
